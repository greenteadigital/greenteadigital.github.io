Having avoided social media for many years for personal infosec reasons, I've finally given in and
started a blog. It may or may not have to do with my status as a developer who is between jobs. OK, it totally has to do with that :)

About the blog: it's a static site generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted for free on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/). Caching and TLS are kindly provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). I'm amazed at the quality of the free tools and services available these days. Thanks guys!

So, if you happen to be looking for a full-stack developer with strong Java skills and an eye for design, hit me up at the links in my header for my full resume. I'm based in western North Carolina, but also enjoy working remotely.

For future posts, I'd like to do a walkthrough of some of my pet personal projects. So, if you have interests in encryption, data visualization, D3.js, Python, or multi-threaded C - I hope you come back! Thanks for reading :)
